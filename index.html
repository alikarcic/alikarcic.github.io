    <h1>Mapping the News Agenda in Bosnia</h1>
    <p>September 2024</p>

    <h2>What is this project about?</h2>
    <p>More than ever before, people rely on the internet for their daily news and information. With the rapid proliferation of internet access across the globe,
        more and more people are turning away from traditional, analogue, news outlets in favor of social media such as Twitter and Facebook, or large online-only news platforms. 
        Given that these web-based news portals have become the primary source of information for a majority of the population, they are naturally of great interest to social scientists, 
        who wish to know more about the media landscape, and what societal priorities the media landscape reflects.</p>

    <p>This project aims to make use of the easily accessible online news data by focusing on <strong><a href="https://klix.ba">klix.ba</a></strong>, the most visited and most influential news portal in Bosnia. 
        By scraping, systematizing, and analyzing all news articles on the website, I aim to map out what type of news Bosnians engage with, and how they engage with it, 
        hopefully providing a unique insight into the broader media trends in the country. The reason for choosing Bosnia is that general efforts into collecting and archiving news articles 
        have been largely absent to my knowledge, underscoring the importance of such work in the future.</p>

    <h2>Key Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Engagement with the News</strong><br>What types of articles do Bosnians read the most? What content generates the highest engagement?</li>
        <li><strong>Identification of Popular Topics</strong><br>What types of news are published most frequently? Has the news agenda changed over time?</li>
        <li><strong>News Production over Time</strong><br>Which topics dominate the news landscape? Are there seasonal or event-driven spikes in certain topics?</li>
        <li><strong>Geographic Distribution of News Content</strong><br>What geographic areas and locations does the news agenda focus on the most? Are some places given more attention than others?</li>
        <li><strong>Coverage of Politics</strong><br>What political parties are mentioned most often in the news? What political leaders are given the most attention?</li>
        <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong><br>Are news articles mostly positive or negative in sentiment? How has sentiment changed over time, and across topics?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Data Source</h2>
    <p>The data is completely sourced from klix.ba via a python web scraper, written using BeautifulSoup.</p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Web Scraping:</strong> Articles are scraped from <strong>klix.ba</strong> using Python and relevant libraries for web scraping.</li>
        <li><strong>Text Analysis:</strong> Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are employed to identify key topics, patterns, and trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Series Analysis:</strong> Trends over time are evaluated to determine shifts in news focus and audience interests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Through this project, we seek to understand the <strong>media landscape in Bosnia</strong> and provide insights into how news is consumed and produced, offering a reflection of <strong>Bosnian societyâ€™s interests</strong> and <strong>media trends</strong>.</p>
